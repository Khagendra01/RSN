This code defines two classes, SChunk and SDNS, which appear to be part of a cognitive architecture or neural network implementation.
SChunk Class:
Represents a chunk, a basic unit of knowledge or pattern.
Has properties:
parent1 and parent2: references to other chunks.
f: a frequency or activation count.
outputs: a map of output values.
subchunks: an array of child chunks.
Methods:
allowActivation(currentTic): checks if the chunk can be activated based on its parents' last activation time.
constructor(p1, p2): initializes the chunk with two parent chunks.
SDNS Class:
Represents a cognitive system or neural network.
Has properties:
VERSION: a version string.
params: an object with parameters (e.g., learning rate, frequency-based or error-driven learning).
inputs: a map of input chunks.
currentTic: the current time step or iteration.
state: an array of currently active chunks.
Methods:
chunkActivate(chunk): activates a chunk and its subchunks.
learnChunking(): learns new chunks based on the most active ones.
updateUerror(chunk, output): updates the output value of a chunk using error-driven learning.
updateUfreq(chunk, output): updates the output value of a chunk using frequency-based learning.
learnOutput(output): updates the output values of all active chunks.
perceive(perceptualCues): activates chunks based on input cues.
expose(inputs, epochs): trains the system with input data for a specified number of epochs.
learnOutputs(cases, epochs): learns output values from labeled cases.
decide(): makes a decision based on the currently active chunks.
train(cases, epochs, epochsO): trains the system with labeled cases.
predict(inputs): makes predictions for a given input array.
The shuffle function at the top is a utility function to shuffle an array randomly.
This code is quite complex, and its specific purpose or behavior would require further analysis and context.
